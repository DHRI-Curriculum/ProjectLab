# Theory to Practice

You are done with the Project Lab workshop, congratulations! Now, let's think a bit further about how you can use this workshop in projects that you're currently working on.<!-- TODO: I think this transition could be a little longer... -->

## Other Tutorials

- Appleford, Simon, and Jennifer Guiliano. [DevDH.org](http://devdh.org), 2013. In this online resource guide, Guiliano and Appleford share recorded lectures as podcasts, slides, and handouts to help scholars develop strong projects. Topics include "Designing Your First Project," "Building Budgets," "Manage Your Project," and more. 

- [PM4DH: Project Management for the Digital Humanities](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/pm4dh/), Emory Center for Digital Scholarship, Accessed 13 June 2020. The staff of the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship has produced a helpful website that includes information on project proposals accompanied with information about project management. Considering how you might manage all aspects of the project's lifecycle will help to inform your own proposal. Consider reviewing a resource such as this one early on in your process. 

## Next Steps

Consider revising your short project proposal for a specific goal. You could consider for example (1) building a project as part of a class, (2) writing a proposal for NEH funding, or (3) applying for faculty develompent or institutional funding to develop a pilot or early version of your project idea.

## Discussion Questions

- Now that you have a project proposal and draft toward a plan, what areas do you need to further develop to make the plan viable? 
- What models of collaboration are you considering for your project? What challenges do you think your project may confront in working with other scholars? 
- How does your project proposal recognize the contributions of various types of intellectual, techical, and emotional labor?
