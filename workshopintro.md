## Workshop Introduction

During this session, you will learn how to design, to plan, and to propose a digital research project. Effective digital projects begin with three critical components: a purpose, a need, and a plan. Once you have those three things in place, you can better assess what resources you will need to bring the project to fruition, to articulate the steps that will be required to bring your project from an abstract idea into reality, and to keep the project on track toward its goal along the way. True, even the best plans may change over the life cycle of the project, but if your project is clearly and resonably articulated, changes along the way will be much easier to accommodate. Your questions may change. Your funding may change. Even the shape your "final" research project takes may change, but a good plan that is well described early on can help the project survive those changes. 

The workshop will take you through a full cycle of project plan development. It will encourage you to visualize and describe a successful "end" to the project. How will you know you've succeeded? How long a life cycle do you intend for the project to have? From there, you will think of the project's intended audiences, as well as the need the project fills, and how it relates to other ongoing work. You'll assess the resources that you can draw on--labor, technologies, data--as well as what additional resources you will need. For example, are there skills that someone on the team will need to have? Will you need to hire someone or train someone? We will develop a workplan, which means articulating when the work will be done, by whom, and by when. Considering how to communicate about your project through outreach, forming effective partnerships, planning for sustainability and data management, and finding funding help to round out the project planning process. 

Each lesson in this workshop ends with prompts to begin a brainstorming process. In the final lesson, we will walk through the steps of drafting a short 2-3 page project proposal.
