## Workshop Introduction

### Overview
During this session, you will learn how to design, to plan, and to propose a digital research project. The workshop will take you through a full cycle of project plan development. It will encourage you to visualize and describe a successful "end" to the project. How will you know you've succeeded? How long a life cycle do you intend for the project to have? From there, you will think of the project's intended audiences, as well as the need the project fills, and how it relates to other ongoing work. You'll assess the resources that you can draw on--labor, technologies, data--as well as what additional resources you will need. For example, are there skills that someone on the team will need to have? Will you need to hire someone or train someone? We will develop a workplan, which means articulating when the work will be done, by whom, and by when. Considering how to communicate about your project through outreach, forming effective partnerships, planning for sustainability and data management, and finding funding help to round out the project planning process. 

Each lesson in this workshop ends with prompts to begin a brainstorming process. In the final lesson, we will walk through the steps of drafting a short 2-3 page project proposal. 

### What makes an effective project plan?
Effective digital projects begin with three critical components: a goal, a need, and a plan. Once you have those three things in place, you can better assess what resources you will need to bring the project to fruition, to articulate the steps that will be required to bring your project from an abstract idea into reality, and to keep the project on track toward its goal along the way. True, even the best plans may change over the life cycle of the project, but if your project is clearly and resonably articulated, changes along the way will be much easier to accommodate. Your questions may change. Your funding may change. Even the shape your "final" research project takes may change, but a good plan that is well described early on can help the project survive those changes. 

### Projects are always about people
This workshop takes a people-centered approach to project design. While you may be planning and proposing a project, it is important to remember that people make projects, and not the other way around. For that reason, we will foreground the role that people play in the project: from conception through implementation to evaluation and preservation. Digital projects are rarely--likely never--individual efforts. Keeping in mind that projects are always, ultimately, about people means that project planning is usually messy. It will require asking for input, surfacing and resolving conflict, re-evaluating your goals, and making peace with something not quite exactly as you had imagined it might be. Then again, if you remember to keep your focus on the people throughout the project, it's more than likely that your project will turn out better than what you had imagined. 

### Burn out? We haven't even started yet!
A people-centered project design process means acknowleding what makes projects messy. Burn out, as it turns out, is an underdiscussed but significant contributor to project failure; therefore, starting the project planning process with a keen sense of what leads to burn out can help avoid problems later on. As academics, we are not taught to consider emotional labor in the design of a scholarly project; however, workplace "burn out" is so ubiquitous and such a significant mental health problem, that the World Health Organization estimates that US$ 1 trillion per year is spent globally in lost productivity. So, I'll put the question another way: can we really afford *not* thinking about burn out when designing a digital project? 

What are primary causes of burnout? [According to the WHO](https://www.who.int/mental_health/in_the_workplace/en/), major contributors to burn out in the work place are: 
- poor communication and management practices;
- limited participation in decision-making or low control over one's area of work;
- unclear tasks or organizational objectives

While an effective project plan may detail the goals, need, and plan for a project, and while those may be key parts of securing funding, support, and visiblity for your project, the real reason why a project plan is so important is because when it is the result of a collaborative, team process, it takes care of the people who will bring that project to fruition. The project plan will articulate how to communication and management of the project will happen. It creates an opening for all members of the project team to contribute to the decision-making process. It clarifies the tasks and organizational objectives, and allows each member of the team to see how their contributions participate in the successful progress toward a shared goal. 

In the end, creating a project plan is the least expensive and most impactful thing you can do to ensure its success.

### But what if I already started with a plan? 
Great! This workshop can be useful to you, too. Even the best and most thoughtfully designed project plans need care and feeding. You may be thinking about a side project for something you are already working on. Perhaps you have a project that you started without a plan, but now you've decided it needs to go in a new direction.
