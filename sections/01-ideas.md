# Begin by Thinking About the End

Usually, digital projects begin with enthusiasm. Maybe it addresses a specific and pressing need. Perhaps it forges exciting collaborations or reaches an audience where the demand for the project is high. In any case, that enthusiasm is important and necessary, but it can also prevent us from having a clear picture of *exactly* what the project's goals are, how you will measure the project's progress toward those goals, and also what to do with the project when it comes to a conclusion.

This lesson prompts you to consider what you really want for and from your project. Knowing what a satisfying ending place might look like can help to clarify the project's true values, to manage the project's scope, and to make important decisions along the way. Communicating this shared vision of an "end" can help create a cohesive sense of purpose among a project team and avoid coflict and disappointment later on. 

## All good things must end  
All digital projects come to an end at some point. There are different kinds of endings, though, some more permanent than others. Knowing how you want your project to end can often mean that the project continues to serve a purpose long after you and others have stopped working on it. While projects aren't people, forgotten projects lead to sad ends. At the very least, one might hope that it is preserved somewhere in case you or someone else would like to learn from your work. 

By admitting that your project may end and by planning for what happens when it is over, you are assuring that the work that was done over the course of the project's lifecycle is not lost. It relieves you of the responsibility of having to keep projects going that you've lost interest in or that might need to become something else, while assuring those who might use your project or learn from it that there will be a record of it for the future.

## Types of Endings
Beginning with the end in mind is complicated by the fact that few digital projects have an end "form" in the way that we think of a monograph. We rarely think of digital scholarship in its "done" form, but sooner or later even if they're not "finished"—so to speak—at some point, these projects end. 

Done can take many different shapes: 

- it can morph into something new;
- it can be retired;
- it can be archived in a repository;
- it can be saved on some form of storage media;
- it can run out of funding; 
- and sometimes **you** are done with it!

So it's helpful to think about what you want "done" to look like before you begin, because then you always have a sense of what will make a satisfactory ending to the work you're about to embark on. 

## Painting done

"Paint done" is a phrase that Brené Brown and her team comes up with and is described in her book *Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts.* While "paint done" depends very heavily on a visual metaphor, which can be complicated for more conceptually-oriented projects, the idea is vital to successful projects. Until everyone working on the project has a shared sense of what "done" means to every other person on the project, accomplishing a shared goal will be frustrating at best. For Brown and her team, "paint done" is a collective, collaborative process. When successful, it exhumes latent assumptions we have about the work and gives a voice to motivations or expectations.  

Typically, digital projects begin with a clear sense of what the value is to its lead scholar or the project director. However, few--if any--digital projects are single-authored projects. When Brown and her team "paint done," the process is collaborative. By "painting" a picture of done as a team, everyone has an opportunity to contribute to the vision of the project as a whole and to see their interests, values, talents, and contributions as an integral part of the project's purpose and design. Facilitating and then documenting the process provides the whole project team with context, value, and connectedness, which are necessary for any well-functioning team and prevent burn out (and remember from the introduction, burn out might even be more important to the success of your project than chosing the right technology). 


## Activity

* Imagine what your project is like when it's over. Imagine what it means to you to set it down and walk away. What will you do with it? How will you know if it succeded? Who was the last person to care about it? Why? 

* Now, Describe your 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience the purpose of your project. 

 * Does it solve a problem? 
 * Meet an institutional need? 
 * Put an existing resource to new use?
