# Assessment

## Quantitative Self-Assessment

Before beginning the workshop, how confident did you feel writing a digital project proposal? 

- I've written many proposals in years past, so this was nothing new to me. 
- I have some experience writing digital project grant proposals, but felt I could improve.
- I've written proposals for other kinds of academic projects, but I have not written a digital project proposal before. 
- I have heard about digital projects before, but I am new to writing academic proposals. 
- I didn't know what a digital project proposal was and have no experience writing one. 

After completing the Project Lab, I would say that: 

- I learned very little. 
- I modestly increased my confidence writing digital project proposals. 
- I discovered new ways to go about designing and planning for a digital project.
- I significantly increased my capacity to write a digital project proposal. 
- I think there should be one more alternative here.

An effective work plan contains the following: 
- The budget, the timeline, and the deliverables 
- The project management tools, the outreach plan, and the website
- The data management plan, the deliverables, and the inventory
- What will be accomplished, the when the task will be completed, and who will complete the task **
- All of the above

## Qualitative Self-Assessment

How might the planning process change depending on the type of digital project you are proposing? 

What areas in your project proposal present the most challenges? Whom might you approach for help in addressing the gaps or holes in your proposal? 

What skills or knowledge gaps do you feel might prevent you from writing an effective proposal?
