*Describe your 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience what the successful completion of your current research project will look like. (Use your research brief to get you started.)


*What will a successful outcome of your project look like? 


*What is the purpose of your project? 
 *Does it solve a problem? Meet an institutional need? Put an existing resource to new use?
