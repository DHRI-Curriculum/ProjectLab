#Articulating Your Ideas

* Describe your project in 2 sentences to a non-expert audience. (Use your research brief to get you started.)
* What will a successful outcome of your project look like? 
* What is the purpose of your project? 
** Does it solve a problem? Meet an institutional need? Put an existing resource to new use?  
* Who is your audience? 
* How will you know if your project is successful?
