## Abstract

The Project Lab is designed to help you develop a  **reasonable, informed, and purposeful plan** for your digital project that can be used with modifications for multiple purposes: to propose a seminar, capstone, or dissertation project; to submit a grant proposal or funding request; to communicate clearly with potential partners or collaborators; to guide project management; or to build out a publication about your work.

In this workshop, you will learn the following skills:

- To identify the purpose of and need for your project
- To place your project within the context of other existing work
- To account for the resources already at your disposal and those you may need
- To locate partners, collaborators, and audiences
- To develop a work plan 
- To communicate your plan
- To evaluate your progress
- To describe how the work and data will be managed and sustained
- To draft an initial project proposal

### Projects that use these skills

All projects involve planning at some stage. Sometimes these plans turn into publications about a project. Other times you may see them as sample grant proposals. Here are some places you could look to find samples of digital project proposals. 

- The Graduate Center's [Provost's Digital Innovation Grants site](http://cuny.is/digitalgrants) features  proposal narratives from successfully funded projects by doctoral students. Look under "Funded Projects" for a list of digital project descriptions, narratives, and white papers for each academic year. 
- The NEH Office of Digital Humanities posts sample application narratives with its call for applications. You can find these at the bottom of the grant program announcements, for example, on the [Digital Humanities Advancement Grant Program](https://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/digital-humanities-advancement-grants) page. 

### Ethical Considerations

Throughout this workshop, you will be prompted to consider the ethical dimensions of your work as it relates to the technologies, funding, labor, and data that the project encompasses. Here are a few preliminary readings to get you started thinking about what to consider as you design your project. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but suggestive. Some readings will be more applicable to the type of project you are working on than others.
